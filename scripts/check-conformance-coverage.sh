# Conformance-coverage guard (#portconformancecoverage).
#
# Fails the build when the canonical corpus in ../lazily-spec/conformance/ grows a
# fixture that no test in this repo even mentions. That is the drift this guard
# exists for: a fixture lands upstream, every binding stays green, and nobody
# learns that one of them is not replaying it.
#
# WHAT THIS CATCHES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT — read before trusting it.
#
# This is a STATIC guard. It greps the test sources for each canonical fixture's
# filename. So:
#   * absent   -> caught. A fixture no test names cannot be being replayed.
#   * present  -> NOT proof of replay. A test may name a fixture in a comment and
#                 hand-transcribe its contents, which is exactly the drift found in
#                 lazily-cpp's queue tests. Only a RUNTIME manifest proves the
#                 bytes were opened, which is what lazily-kt and lazily-cpp do via
#                 LAZILY_CONFORMANCE_MANIFEST.
#
# So a green run here means "no canonical fixture is unmentioned", not "every
# canonical fixture is replayed". Upgrading this binding to the runtime manifest is
# strictly better; this is the portable floor, not the ceiling.
